Hi.
This is Amay Verma.
I have been working with the languages and the tech over the year.
The programming has been an interresting roller coaster with the new technologies and many things to learn in it.
I haven't posted any of my work till now. 
Starting from the day 1 this is some of my minor projects that I did during my days and will be posting many more of my stuff.
I have my hands over many languages like JAVA PYTHON CSS HTML JAVASCRIPT KOTLIN and ongoing many more to be pro in.
